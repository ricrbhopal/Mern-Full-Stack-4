        <h3>What are Data Structures?</h3>
        <p>
          A data structure is a mechanical or logical way that data is organized
          within a program. The organization of data is what determines how a
          program performs. There are many types of data structures, each with
          its own uses. When designing code, we need to pay particular attention
          to the way data is structured. If data isn't stored efficiently or
          correctly structured, then the overall performance of the code will be
          reduced.

        <h3>Why Create Data Structures?</h3>
        <p>
          Data structures serve a number of important functions in a program.
          They ensure that each line of code performs its function correctly and
          efficiently, they help the programmer identify and fix problems with
          his/her code, and they help to create a clear and organized code base.

        <h3>What are some applications of Data structures?</h3>
        <p>Different applications of an array are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An array is used in solving matrix problems.</li>
          <li>Database records are also implemented by an array.</li>
          <li>It helps in implementing a sorting algorithm.</li>
          <li>
            It is also used to implement other data structures like Stacks,
            Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
          </li>
          <li>An array can be used for CPU scheduling.</li>
          <li>Can be applied as a lookup table in computers.</li>
          <li>
            Arrays can be used in speech processing where every speech signal is
            an array.
          </li>
          <li>
            The screen of the computer is also displayed by an array. Here we
            use a multidimensional array.
          </li>
          <li>
            The array is used in many management systems like a library,
            students, parliament, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            The array is used in the online ticket booking system. Contacts on a
            cell phone are displayed by this array.
          </li>
          <li>
            In games like online chess, where the player can store his past
            moves as well as current moves. It indicates a hint of position.
          </li>
          <li>
            To save images in a specific dimension in the android Like 360*1200
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
