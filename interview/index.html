    <h1>Top 50 OOPs Interview Questions & Answers</h1>

    <h3>1) What is OOPS?</h3>
    <p>
      OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming system in which
      programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing
      but an instance of a class.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Write basic concepts of OOPS?</h3>
    <p>Following are the concepts of OOPS:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Abstraction</li>
      <li>Encapsulation</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Polymorphism</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3) What is a class?</h3>
    <p>
      A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the
      blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object.
    </p>

    <h3>4) What is an Object?</h3>
    <p>
      An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state, behavior, and
      identity.
    </p>

    <h3>5) What is Encapsulation?</h3>
    <p>
      Encapsulation is an attribute of an object, and it contains all data which
      is hidden. That hidden data can be restricted to the members of that
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Levels are Public, Protected, Private, Internal, and Protected Internal.
    </p>

    <h3>6) What is Polymorphism?</h3>
    <p>
      Polymorphism is nothing but assigning behavior or value in a subclass to
      something that was already declared in the main class. Simply,
      polymorphism takes more than one form.
    </p>

    <h3>7) What is Inheritance?</h3>
    <p>
      Inheritance is a concept where one class shares the structure and behavior
      defined in another class. If Inheritance applied to one class is called
      Single Inheritance, and if it depends on multiple classes, then it is
      called multiple Inheritance.
    </p>

    <h3>8) What are manipulators?</h3>
    <p>
      Manipulators are the functions which can be used in conjunction with the
      insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on an object. Examples are
      endl and setw.
    </p>

    <h3>9) Explain the term constructor</h3>
    <p>
      A constructor is a method used to initialize the state of an object, and
      it gets invoked at the time of object creation. Rules for constructor are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Constructor Name should be the same as a class name.</li>
      <li>A constructor must have no return type.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>10) Define Destructor?</h3>
    <p>
      A destructor is a method which is automatically called when the object is
      made of scope or destroyed. Destructor name is also same as class name but
      with the tilde symbol before the name.
    </p>

    <h3>11) What is an Inline function?</h3>
    <p>
      An inline function is a technique used by the compilers and instructs to
      insert complete body of the function wherever that function is used in the
      program source code.
    </p>

    <h3>12) What is a virtual function?</h3>
    <p>
      A virtual function is a member function of a class, and its functionality
      can be overridden in its derived class. This function can be implemented
      by using a keyword called virtual, and it can be given during function
      declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      A virtual function can be declared using a token(virtual) in C++. It can
      be achieved in C/Python Language by using function pointers or pointers to
      function.
    </p>

    <h3>13) What is a friend function?</h3>
    <p>
      A friend function is a friend of a class that is allowed to access to
      Public, private, or protected data in that same class. If the function is
      defined outside the class cannot access such information.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend can be declared anywhere in the class declaration, and it cannot
      be affected by access control keywords like private, public, or protected.
    </p>

    <h3>14) What is function overloading?</h3>
    <p>
      Function overloading is a regular function, but it is assigned with
      multiple parameters. It allows the creation of several methods with the
      same name which differ from each other by the type of input and output of
      the function.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
    <pre>
void add (int & a, int & b);
void add (double& a, double& b);
void add (struct bob& a, struct bob& b);
    </pre>

    <h3>15) What is operator overloading?</h3>
    <p>
      Operator overloading is a function where different operators are applied
      and depends on the arguments. Operator, -, * can be used to pass through
      the function, and it has its own precedence to execute.
    </p>

    <h3>16) What is an abstract class?</h3>
    <p>
      An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated. Creation of an
      object is not possible with an abstract class, but it can be inherited. An
      abstract class can contain only an Abstract method. Java allows only
      abstract method in abstract class while other languages allow non-abstract
      method as well.
    </p>

    <h3>17) What is a ternary operator?</h3>
    <p>
      The ternary operator is said to be an operator which takes three
      arguments. Arguments and results are of different data types, and it
      depends on the function. The ternary operator is also called a conditional
      operator.
    </p>

    <h3>18) What is the use of finalize method?</h3>
    <p>
      Finalize method helps to perform cleanup operations on the resources which
      are not currently used. Finalize method is protected, and it is accessible
      only through this class or a derived class.
    </p>

    <h3>19) What are the different types of arguments?</h3>
    <p>
      A parameter is a variable used during the declaration of the function or
      subroutine, and arguments are passed to the function body, and it should
      match with the parameter defined. There are two types of Arguments.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Call by Value</strong> — Value passed will get modified only
        inside the function, and it returns the same value whatever it is passed
        into the function.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Call by Reference</strong> — Value passed will get modified in
        both inside and outside the functions and it returns the same or
        different value.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>20) What is the super keyword?</h3>
    <p>
      The super keyword is used to invoke the overridden method, which overrides
      one of its superclass methods. This keyword allows to access overridden
      methods and also to access hidden members of the superclass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also forwards a call from a constructor, to a constructor in the
      superclass.
    </p>

    <h3>21) What is method overriding?</h3>
    <p>
      Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide the
      implementation of a method that overrides in the main class. It will
      override the implementation in the superclass by providing the same method
      name, same parameter, and same return type.
    </p>

    <h3>22) What is an interface?</h3>
    <p>
      An interface is a collection of an abstract method. If the class
      implements an interface, it thereby inherits all the abstract methods of
      an interface. Java uses Interface to implement multiple inheritances.
    </p>

    <h3>23) What is exception handling?</h3>
    <p>
      An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program.
      Exceptions can be of any type — Runtime exception, Error exceptions. Those
      exceptions are adequately handled through exception handling mechanism
      like try, catch, and throw keywords.
    </p>

    <h3>24) What are tokens?</h3>
    <p>
      A compiler recognizes a token, and it cannot be broken down into component
      elements. Keywords, identifiers, constants, string literals, and operators
      are examples of tokens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even punctuation characters are also considered as tokens. Example:
      Brackets, Commas, Braces, and Parentheses.
    </p>

    <h3>25) What is the main difference between overloading and overriding?</h3>
    <p>
      Overloading is static Binding, whereas Overriding is dynamic Binding.
      Overloading is nothing but the same method with different arguments, and
      it may or may not return the equal value in the same class itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overriding is the same method names with the same arguments and return
      types associated with the class and its child class.
    </p>

    <h3>26) What is the main difference between a class and an object?</h3>
    <p>
      An object is an instance of a class. Objects hold multiple information,
      but classes don't have any information. Definition of properties and
      functions can be done in class and can be used by the object.
    </p>
    <p>
      A class can have sub-classes, while an object doesn't have sub-objects.
    </p>

    <h3>27) What is an abstraction?</h3>
    <p>
      Abstraction is a useful feature of OOPS, and it shows only the necessary
      details to the client of an object. Meaning, it shows only required
      details for an object, not the inner constructors, of an object. Example —
      When you want to switch on the television, it is not necessary to know the
      inner circuitry/mechanism needed to switch on the TV. Whatever is required
      to switch on TV will be shown by using an abstract class.
    </p>

    <h3>28) What are the access modifiers?</h3>
    <p>
      Access modifiers determine the scope of the method or variables that can
      be accessed from other various objects or classes. There are five types of
      access modifiers, and they are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Private</li>
      <li>Protected</li>
      <li>Public</li>
      <li>Friend</li>
      <li>Protected Friend</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>29) What are sealed modifiers?</h3>
    <p>
      Sealed modifiers are the access modifiers where the methods can not
      inherit it. Sealed modifiers can also be applied to properties, events,
      and methods. This modifier cannot be used to static members.
    </p>

    <h3>30) How can we call the base method without creating an instance?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, it is possible to call the base method without creating an instance.
      And that method should be "Static method."
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing Inheritance from that class.-Use Base Keyword from a derived class.
    </p>

    <h3>31) What is the difference between new and override?</h3>
    <p>
      The new modifier instructs the compiler to use the new implementation
      instead of the base class function. Whereas, Override modifier helps to
      override the base class function.
    </p>

    <h3>32) What are the various types of constructors?</h3>
    <p>There are three types of constructors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Default Constructor</strong> — With no parameters.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Parametric Constructor</strong> — With Parameters. Create a new
        instance of a class and also passing arguments simultaneously.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Copy Constructor</strong> — Which creates a new object as a copy
        of an existing object.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>33) What is early and late Binding?</h3>
    <p>
      Early binding refers to the assignment of values to variables during
      design time, whereas late Binding refers to the assignment of values to
      variables during run time.
    </p>

    <h3>34) What is 'this' pointer?</h3>
    <p>
      THIS pointer refers to the current object of a class. THIS keyword is used
      as a pointer which differentiates between the current object with the
      global object. It refers to the current object.
    </p>

    <h3>35) What is the difference between structure and a class?</h3>
    <p>
      The default access type of a Structure is public, but class access type is
      private. A structure is used for grouping data, whereas a class can be
      used for grouping data and methods. Structures are exclusively used for
      data, and it doesn't require strict validation, but classes are used to
      encapsulate and inherent data, which requires strict validation.
    </p>

    <h3>36) What is the default access modifier in a class?</h3>
    <p>
      The default access modifier of a class is Internal and the default access
      modifier of a class member is Private.
    </p>

    <h3>37) What is a pure virtual function?</h3>
    <p>
      A pure virtual function is a function which can be overridden in the
      derived class but cannot be defined. A virtual function can be declared as
      Pure by using the operator =0.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example</strong> —</p>
    <pre>
Virtual void function1() // Virtual, Not pure
Virtual void function2() = 0 // Pure virtual
    </pre>

    <h3>38) What are all the operators that cannot be overloaded?</h3>
    <p>Following are the operators that cannot be overloaded:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Scope Resolution (::)</li>
      <li>Member Selection (.)</li>
      <li>Member selection through a pointer to function (.*)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>39) What is dynamic or run time polymorphism?</h3>
    <p>
      Dynamic or Run time polymorphism is also known as method overriding in
      which call to an overridden function is resolved during run time, not at
      the compile time. It means having two or more methods with the same name,
      same signature but with different implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>40) Do we require a parameter for constructors?</h3>
    <p>No, we do not require a parameter for constructors.</p>

    <h3>41) What is a copy constructor?</h3>
    <p>
      This is a special constructor for creating a new object as a copy of an
      existing object. There will always be only one copy constructor that can
      be either defined by the user or the system.
    </p>

    <h3>
      42) What does the keyword virtual represented in the method definition?
    </h3>
    <p>It means we can override the method.</p>

    <h3>43) Whether static method can use nonstatic members?</h3>
    <p>False.</p>

    <h3>44) What are a base class, subclass, and superclass?</h3>
    <p>
      The base class is the most generalized class, and it is said to be a root
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Subclass is a class that inherits from one or more base classes. The
      superclass is the parent class from which another class inherits.
    </p>

    <h3>45) What is static and dynamic Binding?</h3>
    <p>
      Binding is nothing but the association of a name with the class. Static
      Binding is a binding in which name can be associated with the class during
      compilation time, and it is also called as early Binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamic Binding is a binding in which name can be associated with the
      class during execution time, and it is also called as Late Binding.
    </p>

    <h3>46) How many instances can be created for an abstract class?</h3>
    <p>
      Zero instances will be created for an abstract class. In other words, you
      cannot create an instance of an Abstract Class.
    </p>

    <h3>47) Which keyword can be used for overloading?</h3>
    <p>Operator keyword is used for overloading.</p>

    <h3>48) What is the default access specifier in a class definition?</h3>
    <p>Private access specifier is used in a class definition.</p>

    <h3>49) Which OOPS concept is used as a reuse mechanism?</h3>
    <p>
      Inheritance is the OOPS concept that can be used as a reuse mechanism.
    </p>

    <h3>
      50) Which OOPS concept exposes only the necessary information to the
      calling functions?
    </h3>
    <p>Encapsulation</p>

    <h3>51) What is method hiding?</h3>
    <p>
      Method hiding occurs when a subclass defines a static method with the same
      signature as a static method in the parent class. Unlike method
      overriding, method hiding doesn't involve dynamic binding.
    </p>

    <h3>
      52) What is the difference between abstract class and concrete class?
    </h3>
    <p>
      A concrete class is a regular class that can be instantiated and contains
      complete implementation of all its methods. An abstract class cannot be
      instantiated and may contain abstract methods without implementation.
    </p>

    <h3>53) Can we have multiple classes in a single file?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, we can have multiple classes in a single file. However, only one
      class can be public, and the file name must match the public class name.
    </p>

    <h3>54) What is a singleton class?</h3>
    <p>
      A singleton class is a class that allows only one instance of itself to be
      created. It provides a global point of access to that instance. This is
      achieved by making the constructor private and providing a static method
      to get the instance.
    </p>

    <h3>55) What is a nested class?</h3>
    <p>
      A nested class is a class that is defined within another class. There are
      two types: static nested classes and inner classes (non-static nested
      classes).
    </p>

    <h3>56) What is an anonymous class?</h3>
    <p>
      An anonymous class is a class without a name that is declared and
      instantiated in a single statement. It is used when you need to use a
      class only once.
    </p>

    <h3>57) What is the difference between aggregation and association?</h3>
    <p>
      Association is a general relationship between two classes where one class
      uses another. Aggregation is a specialized form of association that
      represents a "has-a" relationship where the child can exist independently
      of the parent.
    </p>

    <h3>58) What is a package?</h3>
    <p>
      A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and
      interfaces. It helps in avoiding name conflicts and controlling access to
      classes.
    </p>

    <h3>59) What are wrapper classes?</h3>
    <p>
      Wrapper classes are classes that encapsulate primitive data types into
      objects. Examples include Integer, Double, Boolean, Character, etc.
    </p>

    <h3>60) What is autoboxing and unboxing?</h3>
    <p>
      Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their
      corresponding wrapper class objects. Unboxing is the reverse process -
      converting wrapper class objects back to primitive types.
    </p>

    <h3>61) What is a constant?</h3>
    <p>
      A constant is a variable whose value cannot be changed once it is
      assigned. In Java, constants are declared using the 'final' keyword. By
      convention, constant names are written in uppercase.
    </p>

    <h3>62) What is the instanceof operator?</h3>
    <p>
      The instanceof operator is used to test whether an object is an instance
      of a specific class or implements a specific interface. It returns true or
      false.
    </p>

    <h3>63) What is garbage collection?</h3>
    <p>
      Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that
      identifies and removes objects that are no longer needed by the program,
      freeing up memory resources.
    </p>

    <h3>64) Can we override private methods?</h3>
    <p>
      No, private methods cannot be overridden because they are not visible to
      subclasses. However, a subclass can define a method with the same name,
      which is not overriding but a new method.
    </p>

    <h3>65) Can we override final methods?</h3>
    <p>
      No, final methods cannot be overridden. The final keyword prevents method
      overriding in subclasses.
    </p>

    <h3>66) What is the protected keyword?</h3>
    <p>
      The protected keyword is an access modifier that allows access to members
      within the same package and by subclasses in other packages.
    </p>

    <h3>
      67) What is the difference between protected and default access modifiers?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Protected members are accessible within the same package and by subclasses
      in other packages. Default (package-private) members are only accessible
      within the same package.
    </p>

    <h3>68) What is a marker interface?</h3>
    <p>
      A marker interface is an interface with no methods or fields. It is used
      to mark classes that possess a certain property. Examples include
      Serializable, Cloneable, and Remote interfaces.
    </p>

    <h3>69) What is the Serializable interface?</h3>
    <p>
      The Serializable interface is a marker interface used to enable
      serialization of objects. Serialization is the process of converting an
      object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
    </p>

    <h3>70) What is the Cloneable interface?</h3>
    <p>
      The Cloneable interface is a marker interface that indicates that a class
      allows cloning of its objects. Classes implementing this interface can use
      the clone() method.
    </p>

    <h3>71) What is shallow copy vs deep copy?</h3>
    <p>
      Shallow copy creates a new object but references the same nested objects.
      Deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects,
      creating completely independent copies.
    </p>

    <h3>72) What is the difference between == and equals() method?</h3>
    <p>
      The == operator compares object references (memory addresses), while the
      equals() method compares the actual content/values of objects. The
      equals() method can be overridden to provide custom comparison logic.
    </p>

    <h3>73) What is the hashCode() method?</h3>
    <p>
      The hashCode() method returns an integer hash code value for an object. It
      is used in hash-based collections like HashMap and HashSet to efficiently
      store and retrieve objects.
    </p>

    <h3>74) What is the toString() method?</h3>
    <p>
      The toString() method returns a string representation of an object. It is
      commonly overridden to provide meaningful information about the object's
      state.
    </p>

    <h3>75) What is method chaining?</h3>
    <p>
      Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the
      same object in a single statement. Each method returns the current object
      (this), allowing the next method to be called.
    </p>

    <h3>76) What is the Builder pattern?</h3>
    <p>
      The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct
      complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object
      from its representation.
    </p>

    <h3>77) What is the Factory pattern?</h3>
    <p>
      The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an
      interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes. It
      encapsulates object creation logic.
    </p>

    <h3>78) What is the Singleton pattern?</h3>
    <p>
      The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and
      provides a global point of access to that instance. It is implemented by
      making the constructor private and providing a static method to get the
      instance.
    </p>

    <h3>79) What is the Observer pattern?</h3>
    <p>
      The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object
      (subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) and notifies them
      automatically of any state changes.
    </p>

    <h3>80) What is the difference between composition and inheritance?</h3>
    <p>
      Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship and creates a tight coupling
      between classes. Composition represents a "has-a" relationship and creates
      a loose coupling, making the code more flexible and maintainable.
    </p>

    <h3>81) What is the Liskov Substitution Principle?</h3>
    <p>
      The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass
      should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the
      application. Subclasses should extend, not replace, the behavior of the
      parent class.
    </p>

    <h3>82) What is the Open/Closed Principle?</h3>
    <p>
      The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for
      extension but closed for modification. You should be able to add new
      functionality without changing existing code.
    </p>

    <h3>83) What is the Single Responsibility Principle?</h3>
    <p>
      The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only
      one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or
      responsibility.
    </p>

    <h3>84) What is the Interface Segregation Principle?</h3>
    <p>
      The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced
      to depend on methods it does not use. It's better to have many specific
      interfaces than one general-purpose interface.
    </p>

    <h3>85) What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?</h3>
    <p>
      The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should
      not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
      Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on
      abstractions.
    </p>

    <h3>86) What is tight coupling vs loose coupling?</h3>
    <p>
      Tight coupling means classes are highly dependent on each other, making
      changes difficult. Loose coupling means classes are independent and
      interact through interfaces, making the system more flexible and
      maintainable.
    </p>

    <h3>87) What is the difference between static and instance variables?</h3>
    <p>
      Static variables belong to the class and are shared among all instances.
      Instance variables belong to individual objects and each object has its
      own copy.
    </p>

    <h3>88) Can we declare a class as static?</h3>
    <p>
      We cannot declare a top-level class as static. However, we can declare
      nested classes as static (static nested classes).
    </p>

    <h3>89) What is a static block?</h3>
    <p>
      A static block is a block of code that is executed when the class is
      loaded into memory. It is used to initialize static variables or perform
      one-time setup operations.
    </p>

    <h3>90) What is an initializer block?</h3>
    <p>
      An initializer block (or instance initializer block) is a block of code
      that is executed when an object is created, before the constructor. It is
      used to initialize instance variables.
    </p>

    <h3>91) What is the order of execution in a class?</h3>
    <p>
      The order is: 1) Static blocks and static variables (when class is
      loaded), 2) Instance blocks and instance variables (when object is
      created), 3) Constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>92) Can constructors be private?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, constructors can be private. This is commonly used in the Singleton
      pattern to prevent direct instantiation of the class from outside.
    </p>

    <h3>93) What is constructor chaining?</h3>
    <p>
      Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from
      another constructor using this() or super(). It helps in code reuse and
      reduces duplication.
    </p>

    <h3>94) What is the super() method?</h3>
    <p>
      The super() method is used to call the constructor of the parent class. It
      must be the first statement in the child class constructor.
    </p>

    <h3>95) Can we have a constructor in an abstract class?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, abstract classes can have constructors. These constructors are called
      when a concrete subclass is instantiated.
    </p>

    <h3>96) Can we have a constructor in an interface?</h3>
    <p>
      No, interfaces cannot have constructors because interfaces cannot be
      instantiated.
    </p>

    <h3>97) What are default methods in interfaces?</h3>
    <p>
      Default methods (introduced in Java 8) are methods with implementation in
      interfaces. They allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking
      existing implementations.
    </p>

    <h3>98) What are static methods in interfaces?</h3>
    <p>
      Static methods in interfaces (introduced in Java 8) belong to the
      interface itself and cannot be overridden. They are called using the
      interface name.
    </p>

    <h3>99) What is multiple inheritance of type?</h3>
    <p>
      Multiple inheritance of type is when a class implements multiple
      interfaces. This is allowed because interfaces only define method
      signatures without implementation, avoiding the diamond problem.
    </p>

    <h3>100) What is the difference between extends and implements?</h3>
    <p>
      The 'extends' keyword is used for class inheritance (one class inheriting
      from another class or one interface extending another interface). The
      'implements' keyword is used when a class implements an interface.
